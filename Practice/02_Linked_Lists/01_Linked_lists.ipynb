    "### Linked Lists in Python\n",
    "`1. Arrays:` An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or key. The elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, which means they are stored sequentially in the computer's memory. This allows for quick access to any element using its index.\n",
    "\n",
    "`2. Linked Lists:` A linked list, on the other hand, is a collection of elements called nodes. Each node contains two parts: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element points to the next element, creating a chain of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Why Use Linked Lists Instead of Arrays?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are fixed in size once created. This means you need to define the size of the array beforehand, which can be a limitation if you are unsure of the number of elements you'll need. Also, resizing an array (to accommodate more elements) involves creating a new array and copying all the elements from the old array to the new one, which can be inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Linked lists, however, provide several advantages over arrays:__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Dynamic Size:` Linked lists can grow and shrink in size dynamically. This means you do not need to know the number of elements in advance.\n",
    "2. `Efficient Insertions/Deletions:` Inserting or deleting an element in a linked list is more efficient compared to an array, especially when dealing with large datasets. This is because, in linked lists, you only need to update the links, whereas, in arrays, you may need to shift elements.\n",
    "   \n",
    "__Types of Linked Lists:__\n",
    "* `Singly Linked List:` Each node points to the next node and the last node points to None.\n",
    "* `Doubly Linked List:` Each node points to both the next node and the previous node.\n",
    "* `Circular Linked List:` The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Time and Space Complexity:__\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Appending a Node:`\n",
    "    * Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because you need to traverse the entire list to find the last node.\n",
    "    * Space Complexity: O(1), since no extra space is required.\n",
    "* `Prepending a Node:`\n",
    "    * Time Complexity: O(1), as you only need to update the head of the list.\n",
    "    * Space Complexity: O(1), since no extra space is required.\n",
    "* `Deleting a Node:`\n",
